### Limitations and Notes
- **User Input Parameters**:
  - The 7 parameters requiring input are critical for an accurate final rating. Users must source data from reliable platforms (Screener.in, Moneycontrol, NSE/BSE) to avoid relying on defaults.
  - The instructions provided are designed to be actionable, with clear sources and calculation steps.
- **Data Fetching**:
  - `yfinance` reliably provides Debt-to-Equity Ratio, RoE, and Dividend Yield for most NSE stocks, but data may be missing for smaller companies.
  - If `^NSEI` (NIFTY 50) is unavailable, RS will show “Invalid Symbol,” and the score defaults to 50.
- **Error Handling**:
  - The code validates user inputs and handles invalid tickers or missing data gracefully.
  - If errors occur (e.g., no historical data), it prints an error message and exits.
- **Customization**:
  - Adjust scoring thresholds or weights in `calculate_final_rating` to match your preferences.
  - Add more fundamental data sources (e.g., paid APIs like Alpha Vantage) for better coverage.
  - Replace `symbol_trend_rs` with a programmatic calculation (e.g., based on RSI or MACD) if desired.

### Potential Enhancements
- **Automate More Parameters**: Use paid APIs (e.g., Financial Modeling Prep) to fetch Promoter Holding or Profit Growth, reducing user inputs.
- **Dynamic Moat Assessment**: Estimate moat based on financial metrics (e.g., high margins, large market cap).
- **GUI**: Create a graphical interface (e.g., with `tkinter`) for easier input and output.
- **Export Results**: Save the table to a CSV or Excel file.

### Example Workflow
**Stock**: Reliance Industries (`RELIANCE.NS`)
1. **Run the Program**:
   - `python stock_info.py`
2. **Enter Ticker**:
   - Input: `RELIANCE.NS`
